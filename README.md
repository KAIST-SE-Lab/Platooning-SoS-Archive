# Platooning-SoS-Archive
Archive for investigated platooning System-of-Systems (SoS) experimental data and fault knowledge base

In this archive, we provide majorly two types of data for platooning SoS.
First, we provide the analyzed interaction bug report for the platooning SoS collaboration protocol in VENTOS.
We totally identified six unreported bugs by using our TIME clustering approach.
The detailed failure scenarios, code-level locations of bugs, and their possible solutions are provided. 

Next, we provide the experimental data and the ground-truth fault analysis results for each log.
For this time-consuming oracle generation, total of 5 students are participated from Sep, 20 to Nov, 20.
We conducted this process by selecting 4 students who did not have sufficient background knowledge on the platooning protocol in composing the personnel of this small project.
We crossly distributed all logs to at least 2 students and also carried out the final proof-checking for the platooning communication logs.
Finally, we generated 1,000 failed logs and their oracle for the identified six bugs.
We expect that this experimental data could be utilized in various further studies focusing on testing and analyzing large and complex systems, like Cyber-Physical Systems or SoSs.

Based on the experimental data for 1,000 failed logs and oracle, we're continuously appending the data.
